# ReactGrid Cypress tests information

The result of the tests in Cypress written for testing ReactGrid is affected by the screen resolution and screen scaling on Windows.
If you are running tests on Windows and some are failed, make sure you have the screen resolution set to 1980 x 1020
and scaling is set to 100%. On MacOS we have not noticed any differences between the different resolutions.
